#MyNewWebsite

##Description

I made this website in order to advertise myself. I wanted a simple and robust page in order to depict my basic knowledge on HTML and CSS. In thiw page someone can find a link to my Portfolio and my Github page.

##Usage

The page has a navigation pane in the header with three tabs that leed to Contact input, Portfolio and Github page. At the bottom anyone can insert his/her email and name and submit them to me in order to get in touch.

Credits
This page wouldn't exist without the help of my TA's and the collaboration of the bootcamp students.
